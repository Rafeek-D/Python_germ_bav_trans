# Python_germ_bav_trans
Translate from en to bav

Note: some lines of code are commented out. they are for me when I wrote the code and tested various things beforehand and to see what kind of output I get and what type.


I installed the numpy library because I wanted to compare the words using the angles between the words/vectors. but that would be interesting for more dimensional vectors or larger data sets.


After my online course at IBM, I got inspiration and motivation and wanted to write my own project and new code 😎 . Then I got the idea to write a program based on artificial intelligence (AI) probability calculations. And because I live in one of the most beautiful cities in the world, Munich Landeshauptstadt München, and Bavarian is an important dialect here, I coded a small program that translates an English word into Bavarian. After a long time and far too many hours of trial and error (and of course fixing bugs 🙄 , then many other bugs come from many other places 🤕 😵‍💫 ), the model is finally finished. The model is very small and simple and is based on suggestions like in artificial intelligence after calculating the percentage probabilities and comparing them with the data set, if the user thinks so.

So its also a very important model/program. If you come to my city Munich Landeshauptstadt München, you should learn Bavarian and know a few words 😉 🙂 .
